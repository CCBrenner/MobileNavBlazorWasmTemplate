Use intent: Multi-purpose PWA with navigation that aspires to innovate in mobile (PWA) UI/UX

This being a template, the idea is to utilize this repo as a starting point for building your application (or you can take parts or all of it and apply to an existing app).

With this template you get increased accessibility (user mobility) to your PWA's pages even on mobile, allowing for more pages to be contained in your app while still being easily accessible from any location in your app. 

Functionally, this template's design was styled after traditional website drop-down menu access capabilities. It has an added modernized appearance which seeks to emulate a 2010 iPhone advertisements' selling points.

Blazor WebAssembly, C#, & software engineering best practices were utilized in the making of this template. You will find clean code here.

Features:
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Responsive Web Design (RWD)
- Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) - unbiased C# SPA framework for the front-end (no backend) w/JS interoperability (though no JS was used in the making of this template)
- Potential for being converted to Blazor Hybrid (Blazor WebAssembly + Blazor Maui)
- Mobile, tablet, and desktop application navigation with consistent interaction workflow across all three (industry-grade or better)
- Lifted/animatable/manipulatable app container (based on resposiveness & dependency configuration of internal components; see "Animations" in-app)
- Special animations 'page' that overlays all other pages for purposes of controlling the lifted app container (the "main" element of the layout) with class-insertion as the means for applying transitions, resizing & animations
- Options for previewing app as:
      (1) only on mobile; utilize 'closed stage curtain' on other viewport/screen sizes; closed curtain includes message with QR code to easily access the app in the default browser of the user's mobile device (enabling closer proximity to mobile install)
      (2) mobile + demonstration mode of mobile app with message & QR code to easily access the app in the default browser of the user's mobile device (enabling closer proximity to mobile install) & external animations of the app container
      (3) mobile + tablet with demonstration mode for tablet or mobile on viewports/screens of size similar to desktop; message, animations and QR code included
      (4) mobile + tablet + desktop with no demonstration presentation (full RWD)
- Some filler pages
